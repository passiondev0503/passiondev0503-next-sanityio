With COVID-19 drastically changing our daily habits, we may be shifting towards a new normal.
Nearly [one-third](https://www.grocerydive.com/news/nearly-one-third-of-us-households-shopped-for-groceries-online-in-the-pas/575038/)
of U.S. households shopped for groceries online in the past month.

Retailers & restaurants all over the world are adapting to social distancing and pivoting their business model.
At [Hy-Vee](https://hy-vee.com/), we've quickly scaled up our e-commerce efforts and added curbside pickup options.
As of April 13th, our e-commerce orders are **up 588% since last year**.

## How Hy-Vee Has Evolved

[Amazon](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-hire-100-000-warehouse-and-delivery-workers-amid-coronavirus-shutdowns-11584387833) and [Walmart](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/20/business/walmart-hiring-coronavirus/index.html) each recently announced they plan to hire at least 100k workers due to increased demand.
[Instacart](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/23/tech/instacart-hiring/) is hiring 300k more, which would more than double it's current workforce.

Hy-Vee, Inc. is an employee-owned corporation operating more than
265 retail stores across eight Midwestern states with sales of 10 billion annually.
As a tech lead, my primary focus is developing [Aisles Online](https://www.hy-vee.com/grocery/), Hy-Vee’s e-commerce grocery
shopping platform – which serves millions of customers every year.

To better support our customers, we've made a variety of changes.

While many retailers have reserved early hours for high-risk shoppers, Hy-Vee is [one of the first](https://www.grocerydive.com/news/hy-vee-reserves-online-shopping-hours-for-high-risk-customers/575274/)
to set aside online time slots for the same group.

## Curbside Pickup

With "shelter in place" in all but [five states](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-stay-at-home-order.html) (as of 4/13/2020), many of our favorite
restaurants have closed up shop. While some have transitioned to takeout only,
others could not sustain and had to shut down and furlough employees. With grocery stores remaining open and being an [essential need](https://www.supermarketnews.com/online-retail/h-e-b-hy-vee-feed-customers-expanded-online-services)
during this crisis, pre-made meals needed to be part of our online offering now more than ever. Our direction from the CEO was clear.

**We need to enable our customers, especially those high-risk, to order ready-to-eat meals online and pick them up curbside.**

We do have a restaurant sub-brand [Market Grille](https://marketgrille.hy-vee.com/), but it's only available at a subset of stores.
We wanted to create a set of ready-to-eat meals that all 265 stores could offer as a takeout option.

With little time to act, we explored how we could get a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) out in under two weeks.
When dealing with over 80,000 employees, it can be challenging to introduce new processes in our stores rapidly.
Our technology and operations teams worked closely together to create a mechanism for ordering these items online,
and also training, equipping, and educating our store employees on the new curbside pickup process.

We soft-launched [Mealtime To Go](https://www.hy-vee.com/corporate/news-events/news-press-releases/hyvee-offers-online-ordering-through-mealtime-to-go/)
on Friday, April 3rd. Since launching, we've seen thousands of orders and an exponential rise in usage.

- **2,000** curbside orders at over **200** stores
- <strong>{'$50,000'}</strong> in Mealtime To Go sales

## Conclusion

Increased e-commerce demand has required coordination across all facets of our business.
We've had to scale up resources to handle the increased traffic and hire additional workers to keep operations running smoothly.
Until a vaccine for COVID-19 is developed, we can anticipate continued usage of our online platforms.

How much of this forced e-commerce adoption will stick after COVID-19 is long and gone? That's the million-dollar question.
