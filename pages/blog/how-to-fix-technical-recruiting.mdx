# How To Fix Technical Recruiting

<Date>{meta.date}</Date>

A few months ago, I posted an article called <Link slug="blog/technical-recruiting-is-broken" title="Technical Recruiting is Broken" >Technical Recruiting is Broken</Link>.
I was frustrated with being incorrectly targeted by recruiters and wanted to share my perspective on what was broken with the process.

The response I recieved was overwhelming.

Over **10,000 page views** and **200 comments** from engineers sharing their stories about why technical recruiting was broken to them.
One person who was particularly moved was [Angie Verros](https://www.linkedin.com/in/averros), the organizer behind [Talent42](https://www.talent42.com/home).

> Talent42 is the national conference focused 100% on helping recruiters hire top technology talent. We bring you keynotes from engineering leaders, tech recruiting leader presentations and panels, hands-on roundtables, and training. Companies like Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Target, Costco, Uber, Disney, Nike, NBC, Etsy, and many search firms send their tech recruiting teams to participate in this practical, how-to conference that’s all about sourcing, interviewing, and closing the best tech talent on earth.

Angie wanted me to come out to Seattle and speak at Talent42 to share an engineer's perspective on technical recruiting.

Challenge accepted 💁🏻‍♀️

## Going to Seattle ✈️

After committing to speak at Talent42, I spent the following months up until the conference doing research, preparing my slides, and practicing.

I took my own personal experiences and combined them with my peers and others in the industry to explain what is broken, _why_ it's broken, and shared what we can do to over 100 top recruiters.
