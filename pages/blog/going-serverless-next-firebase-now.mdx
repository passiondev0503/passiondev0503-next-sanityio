A critical step in freelance development is assessing your client's business problem and finding the best technology to solve it. "Best" could mean a variety of things depending on the client: cheap, fast, robust, future-proof, or industry standard. This post will outline how I assessed a business problem, chose the "best" technology, and delivered a timely solution to my client.

[BeyondHQ](https://beyondhq.co/) is an early-stage startup that helps companies expand outside of San Francisco. Think "Expansion-as-a-Service" - finding the right city, opening an office, growing your team, etc. They needed a basic website explaining who, what, and why - as well as a platform to build their SaaS solutions on top of. That's where I came in.

## The Requirements

For the main website, the requirements were fairly straight forward:

-   Basic splash page with information about the product.
-   About page with information on the employees.
-   Frequently asked questions page.
-   Save off information from a contact form.
-   Cheap hosting. Ideally free.

They also wanted a platform to build SaaS on. That meant I needed to consider more requirements, as it would be the next bit of functionality I would create.

The first step towards their full-featured SaaS product was a [location evaluation tool](https://beyondhq.co/geo-eval). Users could enter information like their company size, the number of employees, and potential expansion locations to get a list of their top city matches. Then, they could explore each city and see metrics about what made it an attractive option to expand to. Those requirements were a bit more complex:

-   Resilient, highly available, and fast.
-   Cheap storage. Ideally free.
-   Great SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
-   City pages should be dynamic and pull from a database.
-   The ability for non-technical people to easily edit data.
-   Save off lead generation information from user input.

## The Technology

Given these requirements, what technical choices did I make and why? Let's take a look.

### React

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is the industry-standard for building modern web applications. Of 90,000 developers [surveyed by Stack Overflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019), React was the most loved and most wanted. This technology provides a platform for the main website, as well as any future SaaS.

### Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) makes it easy to build scalable, performant React code. It's blazing fast and uses server-side rendering to improve SEO. On top of that, it simplifies the developer experience and provides a future-proof platform for the BeyondHQ team.

### Now

Deploying serverless applications couldn't be easier with [Now](https://zeit.co/now). It's resilient, [highly available](https://zeit.co/smart-cdn), and fault-tolerant. Plus, it has an excellent [free tier](https://zeit.co/pricing) with the ability to scale as needed.

### Firebase

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is the industry standard [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) platform. It has a sufficient user/permissions system and an easy interface for non-technical users. Did it mention it has a generous [free tier](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)? Firebase's [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore/) product allowed us to save off contact info, city information, and user's lead gen input. It was a no-brainer!

Why use NoSQL? There weren't any requirements which needed a relational database. If there were, I might have considered [Postgres on Hasura](https://hasura.io/) instead.

## The Solution

After reviewing the requirements and choosing the technology, the next step was to begin implementing a solution. But first, mockups!

![BeyondHQ](/static/images/going-serverless-next-firebase-now/geo-eval.png)

I iterated over a handful of designs and went back and forth with the team, tweaking things based on their feedback. We eventually agreed on a mockup and the coding commenced.

### The Server

To use Firebase, we need to create a Node.js API. This will allow us to use `firebase-admin` to communicate with our Cloud Firestore database.

After generating a service account in Firebase, you can create a server like so:

```js
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const admin = require('firebase-admin');

const server = express();

const firebase = admin
    .initializeApp(
        {
            credential: admin.credential.cert(require('../.firebase/service-account.json')),
            databaseURL: 'https://your-name-here.firebaseio.com'
        },
        'server'
    )
    .firestore();

server.use(cors());
server.use(bodyParser.json());
server.use((req, _res, next) => {
    req.firebaseServer = firebase;
    next();
});

module.exports = server;
```

Then, you're able to define routes to communicate with your database.

```js
try {
    const server = require('../../lib/server');

    server.get('/api/cities', (req, res) => {
        req.firebaseServer
            .collection('cities')
            .get()
            .then((snapshot) => {
                const cities = [];

                snapshot.forEach((doc) => {
                    cities.push(doc.data());
                });

                res.json({cities});
            })
            .catch((error) => {
                res.json({error});
            });
    });

    module.exports = server;
} catch (error) {
    console.log('API Error', error);
}
```

That's it for the server infrastructure. From here, it's easy to create new routes and add functionality. You can view the completed example [here](https://github.com/leerob/nextjs-now-firebase).

### The Client

Since we already created a custom API, we can use Next's default server to communicate with Firebase. Let's configure the app to be [serverless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing) via `next.config.js`.

```js
module.exports = {
    target: 'serverless'
};
```

While the majority of the requirements were centered around creating basic React components, there's one part which requires more explanation: [dynamic routing](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-dynamic-pages). For the city pages, we needed to be able to pass a city name as a route (e.g. `/city/des-moines`) and fetch data from our custom API.

The magic happens in our `now.json` file, which defines how the apps will be deployed. We can route all requests to `/api/` to our Node API:

```json
{
    "src": "/api/(.*)",
    "dest": "/app/routes/api"
}
```

and all requests to `/city/city-name/` to forward a query param along to a `City` component.

```json
{
    "src": "/city/(?<name>[^/]+)$",
    "dest": "/www/city?name=$name"
}
```

Finally, we can create `/pages/city/js` inside our Next app to fetch the query param for the city name and call our Node API.

```js
import {useEffect, useState} from 'react';
import fetch from 'isomorphic-unfetch';

function City() {
    const [city, setCity] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        async function fetchData() {
            const cityName = window.location.pathname.split('/').pop();
            const baseUrl =
                process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? `https://${window.location.host}` : 'http://localhost:3000';
            const res = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/api/city/${cityName}`);
            const data = await res.json();

            setCity(data);
        }

        fetchData();
    }, []);

    return city ? city.name : 'Loading...';
}

export default City;
```

This gives you the flexibility to add a loading state or placeholder to improve your user experience.

Much better! ðŸŽ‰
