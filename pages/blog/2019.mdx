# 2019 Year in Review

<Date>{meta.date}</Date>

![2019 Year in Review](/static/images/2019/banner.jpg)

2019 was arguably my best year to date, both professionally and personally.
This was the second year I set detailed yearly goals and held myself accountable for reaching them. Overall, **I met 90% of my goals**.

## Highlights

-   üíçGot engaged!
-   üè°Bought a townhome with my fianc√©e
-   üöÄPromoted to Software Engineer III
-   üìàGained >100 newsletter subscribers
-   üìöWrote 24 articles which amassed over 150,000 views
-   üé§Spoke in front of >100 people at a conference in Seattle

## Personal

Hands down, my biggest life event this year was getting engaged to my now fianc√©e Allie.
I planned a surprise party so her family and friends could all be there to celebrate the moment. It was unforgettable.

<!-- Include pictures? -->

Shortly after, I sold my condo and purchased a new townhome with Allie. This was not a simple process.
Part of the complexity came from listing "for sale by owner" instead of with a realtor.
I could write an entire article on the pros & cons of owning vs. renting, but let's just say it was a long three-month process.

I had the opportunity to travel a lot this year. Denver (x2), Kansas City (x2), Milwaukee, Exuma, and last but not least <Link slug="blog/italy" title="Backpacking Italy">Italy</Link> üáÆüáπ
I attended lots of concerts, including my two current favorite bands [LANY](https://thisislany.com) and [The Band CAMINO](https://www.thebandcamino.com/).

## Professional

At the start of 2019, I was finally getting settled into my <Link slug="blog/joining-hy-vee" title="Joining Hy-Vee">new role at Hy-Vee.</Link>
It's been a year of **exponential growth** üìà

While I learned a great deal in my 3 years at Workiva, the bulk of the learning came in the first year.
After that, there was less exploration of new tools & technologies and more specialized work on our product.

The problem was that a good portion of the tech we used was either not widely used across the industry, or only relevant to Workiva.
This did not translate well when it was time to switch companies. _Ouch_.

Luckily, I've always enjoyed learning and was hungry for a new challenge.
Thanks to some great teammates and peers, **I've learned more in 2019** than I did in 3 years at Workiva.
This is not an all-encompassing list, but I gained significant experience with the following:

-   <Link slug="blog/things-ive-learned-building-nextjs-apps" title="Things I've Learned Building Next.js Apps">Next.js</Link>
-   <Link slug="blog/graphql-at-hy-vee" title="GraphQL at Hy-Vee">GraphQL</Link>
-   <Link slug="blog/graphql-at-hy-vee" title="GraphQL at Hy-Vee">Apollo Client</Link>
-   <Link slug="blog/going-serverless-next-firebase-now" title="Going Serverless with Next.js, Firebase, and Now">Zeit Now</Link>
-   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
-   <Link slug="blog/real-time-post-views" title="Real-Time Blog Post Views with React and Firebase">React Hooks</Link>
-   [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
-   <Link slug="blog/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems" title="Everything I Know About Style Guides, Design Systems, and Component Libraries">Design Systems</Link>
-   [Component Libraries](https://medium.com/hy-vee-engineering/building-a-ui-component-library-with-styled-components-8f033aaa3d52)
-   [CSS-in-JS](https://medium.com/hy-vee-engineering/building-a-ui-component-library-with-styled-components-8f033aaa3d52)

This knowledge and experience led to other endeavors.

-   I landed my largest freelance client, **[BeyondHQ](https://beyondhq.co/)**, and built an <Link slug="blog/going-serverless-next-firebase-now" title="Going Serverless with Next.js, Firebase, and Now">entire web application</Link> using Next.js, React, Firebase, and styled-components.
-   Launched **[Mastering Next.js](https://masteringnextjs.com/)**, a 50+ lesson video course for building applications with Next.js and React.
-   Started **[dsmtech.io](https://dsmtech.io/)** to promote tech companies in the DSM area and help engineers find job opportunities (featured in [Innovation Iowa](https://innovationia.com/2019/01/03/dsmtech-io-launches-for-tech-job-seekers-scouting-des-moines/) üöÄ).

There were a few other notable parts of 2019 worth mentioning.

-   I was promoted to Software Engineer III at Hy-Vee üéâ I'm leading the design system architecture for our organization of ~150 engineers. New components are built with React, Storybook, and styled-components.
-   I've been apart of the [Diversity & Inclusion Committee](https://www.technologyiowa.org/Priorities/ShowPriority?id=4) for the Technology Association of Iowa.

## Conference Talks

In February, I posted an article called <Link slug="blog/technical-recruiting-is-broken" title="Technical Recruiting is Broken">_Technical Recruiting is Broken_</Link>.
I was frustrated with being incorrectly targeted by recruiters and wanted to share my perspective on what was broken with the process.

The response I received was overwhelming.

Over **10,000 page views** and **200 comments** from engineers sharing their stories about why technical recruiting was broken and their experiences.
One person who was particularly moved was [Angie Verros](https://www.linkedin.com/in/averros), the organizer behind [Talent42](https://www.talent42.com/home).

> Talent42 is the national conference focused 100% on helping recruiters hire top technology talent. We bring you keynotes from engineering leaders, tech recruiting leader presentations and panels, hands-on roundtables, and training. Companies like Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Target, Costco, Uber, Disney, Nike, NBC, Etsy, and many search firms send their tech recruiting teams to participate in this practical, how-to conference that‚Äôs all about sourcing, interviewing, and closing the best tech talent on earth.

Angie wanted me to come out to Seattle and speak at Talent42 to share an engineer's perspective on technical recruiting.
Coincidentally, one of my goals for 2019 was to speak at a national conference. _Challenge accepted!_

![Talent42 Recruiting Conference](/static/images/2019/talent42.png)

This talk was one of my favorite moments of the year. I walked on that stage with more confidence than I've ever felt.
It was an incredible feeling. This inspired me to speak at <Link slug="speaking" title="Speaking">4 other events</Link> in 2019.

## Writing

I wrote **24 articles** in 2019 and amassed over **150,000 views!** üò±Here are some of my most popular.
