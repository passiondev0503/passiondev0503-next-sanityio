# Configuring Sentry for Next.js Apps

<Date>{meta.date}</Date>

For many teams using Next.js, setting up exception monitoring is a critical requirement before going to production.
This guide will show you how to use [Sentry](https://sentry.io) to catch & report errors on both client and server-side.

## Brief Next.js Overview

Next.js allows you to easily server-side render (SSR) your React components. All files inside the `/pages` directory will be routed based on their filename (e.g. `/pages/home.js` routes to `your-domain.com/home`).

There are a few Next-specific routes you should understand:

-   `_document.js` is _server-side only_ and is used to change the initial server-side rendered document markup.
-   `_app.js` is client-side only and is used to initialize pages.

## Implementing Sentry

There are a few different ways to integrate Sentry into your Next.js app, each with their own pros and cons. This guide will focus on a simple example and provide a reference for how to expand your Sentry setup as needed.

### Simple Setup

_You can view the completed example [here](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/7119)._

1. Set up an account with [Sentry](https://sentry.io) and retrieve your DSN.
2. Add Sentry to your project. Here is an example `package.json`.

```json
{
    "name": "with-sentry-simple",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "license": "ISC",
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "next",
        "build": "next build",
        "start": "next start"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "@sentry/browser": "^5.1.0",
        "@zeit/next-source-maps": "0.0.4-canary.1",
        "next": "latest",
        "react": "^16.8.6",
        "react-dom": "^16.8.6"
    }
}
```

3. Override `_app.js` to initialize Sentry and capture client-side exceptions using the `componentDidCatch` React lifecycle method.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import App, {Container} from 'next/app';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';

Sentry.init({
    dsn: 'ENTER_YOUR_SENTRY_DSN_HERE'
});

class MyApp extends App {
    static async getInitialProps({Component, ctx}) {
        let pageProps = {};

        if (Component.getInitialProps) {
            pageProps = await Component.getInitialProps(ctx);
        }

        return {pageProps};
    }

    componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
        Sentry.withScope((scope) => {
            Object.keys(errorInfo).forEach((key) => {
                scope.setExtra(key, errorInfo[key]);
            });

            Sentry.captureException(error);
        });

        super.componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo);
    }

    render() {
        const {Component, pageProps} = this.props;

        return (
            <Container>
                <Component {...pageProps} />
            </Container>
        );
    }
}

export default MyApp;
```

4. Override `_document.js` to capture server-side exceptions by listening at the node process level.

```jsx
import Document, {Html, Head, Main, NextScript} from 'next/document';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';

process.on('unhandledRejection', (err) => {
    Sentry.captureException(err);
});

process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => {
    Sentry.captureException(err);
});

class MyDocument extends Document {
    static async getInitialProps(ctx) {
        const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx);
        return {...initialProps};
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <Html>
                <Head />
                <body>
                    <Main />
                    <NextScript />
                </body>
            </Html>
        );
    }
}

export default MyDocument;
```

5. Override `next.config.js` to produce source maps.

```js
const withSourceMaps = require('@zeit/next-source-maps')();

module.exports = withSourceMaps({
    webpack(config, _options) {
        return config;
    }
});
```

### Complex Setup

Next has an example [with-sentry](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-sentry) which contains more functionality but is also more complex. Building off the simple example, it also:

-   Reports the `BUILD_ID` as a release inside Sentry.
-   Contains a custom error reporting page to allow users to submit feedback.
-   Uses cookies for a more accurate user count between client and server.

There are still a [few](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/1622) [issues](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/1762) with it, so I wouldn't recommend using it as a base for now.
You might be able to extract pieces of the complex example and apply them as you see fit.

## Other Notes

-   Source maps will not be sent to Sentry successfully when running locally.
-   It's possible you will see duplicate errors sent when testing locally due to hot reloading.
    For a more accurate simulation, please deploy to whatever service you use for hosting (e.g. Now).
